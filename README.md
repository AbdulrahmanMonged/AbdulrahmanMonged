# Abdulrahman Monged  
Python Lover • Backend & Web Developer • Algorithm Enthusiast

## 👋 About Me  
Hi there! I’m Abdulrahman, a software engineer passionate about building clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.  
With a strong footing in **Python** and **JavaScript (Node.js & React)**, I tackle real-world problems spanning automation, web scraping, backend REST APIs, real-time systems, and interactive front-ends.

Here’s a snapshot of my tech passions:  
- ✅ Backend development with **Flask** and **FastAPI**  
- ✅ Real-time communication using **Socket.IO** (via `fastapi_socketio`)  
- ✅ Web scraping and browser automation (Selenium, BrowserMob Proxy)  
- ✅ Front-end development with **React**, **React Router**, and **Framer Motion** animations  
- ✅ Deployment & DevOps: Hosting full-stack apps using **Caddy**, **Gunicorn**, **Ubuntu**, **Windows Server**, and leveraging **CDN (Bunny.net)** for global delivery  
- ✅ Data structures & algorithms: Solving problems, preparing for interviews, improving code-efficiency  

## 📂 What I’m Working On  
- Building and deploying a full-stack video-processing app: backend in FastAPI + real-time updates + frontend in React with WebSocket integration.  
- Implementing global content distribution via Bunny.net to handle video downloads and streaming.  
- Deepening my understanding of rate-limiting with Redis, multi-page GUI applications in CustomTkinter (including Arabic/RTL support), and optimization of rich UIs.  
- Consistently solving algorithmic challenges (e.g., LeetCode) and refining space/time complexity analysis.
